# Python Workshop
This repository consists of python (Jupyter Notebook) code and resources that I catered to students during a python workshop that I conducted as a part of Encode (Computer Science Club).

# Time Series Prediction

The project is a stock market (time series) prediction model with input features that include adjusted closing price, adjusted volume, high low percentage and percentage change to predict future price of stock (with help of linear regression using Scikit Learn library) alongwith Pandas statistical and matplotlib & seaborn visualization libraries; resulting in 99+ % accuracy.

# Instagram Post Prediction

The project is an instagram post reach prediction ML model (based on multivariate regression) with input features that include followers and time/likes to predict likes/time of a particular post (created using Scikit Learn library) alongwith Pandas statistical and matplotlib & seaborn visualization libraries.
